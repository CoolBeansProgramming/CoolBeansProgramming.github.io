# My Portfolio Webpage Project 
Here is my first attempt at creating my portfolio site! I created this to display my data science projects and to tell a little bit more about myself. 

##  Tools 
* HTML
* CSS
* a fraction of JavaScript 
* Git
* GitHub
 
## Future Work
I plan to revisit this project later next year to make the site more responsive as the pages do not hold together well on smaller screens like phones but looks great on PC monitors.

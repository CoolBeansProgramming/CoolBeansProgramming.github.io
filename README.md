# My Portfolio Webpage Project 
Here is version one of my portfolio site! I created this to display my data science projects and to tell a little bit more about myself. I plan to revisit this project later to improve the responsiveness on mobile screens. The site features welcome page with featured projects and links to my other accounts, an About Me page with more details about my background and what I currently do now, a page showing all of my side projects, and a general road map that I am currently following.
